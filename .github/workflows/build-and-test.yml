    # If this step is failing with an E401, it's probably because the package-lock.json is specifying dependencies that are not available in the public npm registry 
    # (which would happen if your local NPM is set up to use the CoxAuto private NPM registry). To fix this, delete the node_modules folder and package-lock.json
    # files, and then run `npm i --registry https://registry.npmjs.org` locally. This will generate a new package-lock.json file that only references packages 
    # available in the public npm registry.
